        "question": "How would you design and implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangGraph, given your experience with LangChain and HuggingFace Transformers, and what specific technical challenges do you anticipate in integrating LangGraph with your existing skill set?",
        "category": "Technical",
        "reasoning": "This question is relevant because it assesses the candidate's ability to apply their existing knowledge of generative AI and retrieval-augmented generation to a new technology (LangGraph), and evaluates their problem-solving skills in integrating new tools with their existing technical expertise."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you describe how you would design and implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline using LangGraph, and how you would optimize it for efficient information retrieval in a multi-agent workflow?",
        "category": "Technical",
        "reasoning": "This question is relevant because it assesses the candidate's ability to apply their skills in generative AI, LLM deployment, and prompt engineering to a specific technical problem, while also evaluating their understanding of LangGraph and RAG pipelines, which are key requirements for the AI Engineer job."

      {
        "question": "Can you design a high-level architecture for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline using LangGraph, and explain how you would integrate it with a multi-agent workflow for complex automation, considering your experience with LangChain and HuggingFace Transformers?",
        "category": "Technical",
        "reasoning": "This question assesses the candidate's ability to apply their knowledge of generative AI, LLM deployment, and prompt engineering to a specific technical problem, while also evaluating their understanding of LangGraph and its potential applications in agentic AI systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you describe a situation where you had to learn and adapt to a new technology or framework quickly, and how you overcame any challenges that arose during the process?",
        "category": "Behavioral",
        "reasoning": "This question is relevant because the candidate lacks experience in LangGraph and has no experience with the OpenAI API, so it's essential to assess their ability to learn and adapt to new technologies quickly, which is a crucial skill for an AI Engineer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you describe a situation where you had to learn and adapt to a new technology or framework that was not part of your initial skill set? How did you approach the learning process, and what strategies did you use to overcome any challenges you encountered?",
        "category": "Behavioral",
        "reasoning": "This question is relevant because the candidate lacks experience in LangGraph and has no experience with the OpenAI API, which are key requirements for the AI Engineer role. By asking about their ability to learn and adapt to new technologies, we can assess their potential to quickly get up to speed with the required tools and frameworks."

        "question": "Suppose you're tasked with designing an agentic AI system using LangGraph for a complex automation task. However, you notice that the system requires integration with an external knowledge graph that is only accessible through the OpenAI API. How would you approach this problem, given your experience with LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, but lack of direct experience with LangGraph and the OpenAI API?",
        "category": "Problem-Solving",
        "reasoning": "This question assesses the candidate's ability to think critically and apply their knowledge of generative AI, LLM deployment, and prompt engineering to a novel problem, while also considering the limitations of their experience with LangGraph and OpenAI API."
